Welcome to Fastplay!
Fastplay is a very lightweight, simple, yet powerful and flexible media player for Windows. It is designed to be accessible, minimalistic, yet powerful, all at the same time. It is also very small, and fast and responsive.
Note! Fastplay is not designed to be a replacement for a complete media player. Rather, it's designed to be a small, lightweight media player that you can either use seriously or for fun! It has a vast list of effects including an EQ, reverb, echo, tempo/pitch, stereo width, and more, which you can adjust in realtime (See below).
At the core of Fastplay are what we will call virtual sliders. Right now, there are two of these virtual sliders.
The first one adjusts things like your volume and any effects you choose to enable/add. You choose what this slider adjusts by using left and right brackets, and then adjust the value itself with up or down arrows.
The second slider allows you to do things such as seek and move between tracks. You adjust what this slider does by using comma and period, and you adjust the slider with left and right arrows.
You can choose what shows up in these sliders by heading to the options dialog, control comma.
The rest of the app is pretty explanitory. Just check out the menus for the rest of the keyboard shortcuts. Some of the other features include:
* Basic Youtube search
* Completely configurable Global hotkeys
* MIDI support
* ID3 tags with numbers 1 through 0.
* URL stream support
* Load all files in folder when clicking on a file.
* Remember playback position of files
* Able to set as default for filetypes.

Enjoy this early beta!
